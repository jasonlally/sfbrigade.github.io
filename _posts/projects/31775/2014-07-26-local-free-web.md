A resource directory of internet sites in San Francisco

The following resources have been used:

SFMTA transit data that includes a list(seemingly not comprehensive) of all bus stops and their meta data ie; address, ID, Geocode. Here is the website to access it: http://www.sfmta.com/about-sfmta/reports/gtfs-transit-data

EveryOneOn.org has a json file that can be accessed of their locations in and around SF: http://api.everyoneon.org/json.php?zip=94109&distance=20&limit=500

SF's public libraries: http://sfpl.org/pdf/libraries/sfpl421.pdf
